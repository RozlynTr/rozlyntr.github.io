    <h3>Target Audience</h3>
    <p>The target audience will primarily be adults, more specifically individauls between the ages of 25-65. 
      The primary users are people looking for a reliable and accurate information covering their town and surrounding county areas.
      The reason I am "limiting" the audience to adults is because generally, older individuals are more interested about current
      events and stay caught up on local news than a younger audience. </p>
      <p>We also expect to have users with a wide range of experience with technology. Therefore, the website will need to
        be user friendly for people with little experience with technology. </p>
      <p>The median age of the three counties is about 36
        years old. </p>
       <p> The median income is approximately $57,000 annually. With this information, we expect most of our users to
      come from households with adults and young children. We expect that they will be looking for events which are family
      friendly.
    </p>
    <h3>Persona 1: Susan</h3>
    <p>Susan is a 42 year old married mother of five kids. She is an elementary school special education teacher in Preston, ID. 
      Susan relies on Southeast Idaho News to provide accurate weather forecasting and information on local events for her family to attend
      as well as to plan her teaching schedule around (potential field trips for her class, outdoor vs indoor activities, etc.)
      Her kids are Rose (20), David (18), Bell (15), Wilden (12) and Elizabeth (9). The younger kids enjoy the local sports 
      such as Little League and soccer and the older kids are always wanting to go to local events such as school football games or fundraisers. 
      When Susan has time in her crazy life, she enjoys going on hikes and being outdoors with her family. On these outings, she enjoys taking
      photos of weather phenomenon especially thunderstorms blowing in over mountains.

    <h3>Persona 2: Kyle </h3>
    <p>Kyle is a 26 year old bachelor that enjoys being outdoors more than indoors. He is a construction site manager for
      a local residential construction company that serves the tri-county area. He recently graduated with a bachelor's
      degree in construction management. Now he enjoys his extra time since he longer attends college. When he is not at
      work, Kyle can be found out in the local forest or at a local lake. He enjoys backpacking, camping, fishing,
      and hunting. He relies strongly on accurate weather forecasts. When he plans his activities, he utilizes the
      forecast to ensure that he is prepared for the weather. He enjoys sharing his outdoor experiences with others and writes a
      weekly article about the local outdoor activities that are available in the area.

    <h3>Scenario 3</h3>
    <p>My husband's childhood friend and her husband will be coming to town for the weekend. What events are happening this weekend? What
      attractions are there in the area for young adults and people that have never been to southeastern Idaho?
    </p>
    <p>Each city page will have a calendar of events. Also, the tourist office for each town often has lists of
      attractions in their city. The contact information for the tourist office can be found on each city page. Google
