      <h3>White Space and Clean Design</h3>
      <h4>Quip</h4>
      <img src="https://rozlyntr.github.io/images/quipsite.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the home page for Quip.">
      <p>I chose the website for Quip because it is a beautiful example of white space and clean design. I love that
        it is straight to the point, there is no question about what the site is for and that it is all spaced well. </p>
      <p></p>
        <p>The designer clearly had a good grasp of white space because the entire site utilizes this principle -- as you scroll
        down the page, nothing is too cluttered or busy; there are some designs that can be a bit TOO simple. In this case,
        however, the minimalist approach is countered with motion graphics rather than still images to create a beautiful
        and visually interesting compostiion.

      <h3>Proximity and Grouping</h3>
      <h4>Kansas City, Missouri</h4>
      <img src="https://rozlyntr.github.io/images/kansassite.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the home page for Kansas, City MO">
      <p>This is a site that I have actually been referencing quite a bit when it comes to designing a webpage.
        For another course I'm currently studying, we were tasked with redesigning the Loup County, NE website. </p>
       <p> Kansas City, Missouri's site does a great job of utilizing proximity to help the viewer understand what information
        is at their disposal and what it relates to. Certain elements are closer together than others to indicate
        a group or related content but not so close that it gets crammed and confusing. For example, certain images that correlate 
        to specific text are closer to each other. Another example are the buttons that are in close proximity to text to indicate a
        link to the same information.

      <h3>Alignment</h3>
      <h4>Ling's Cars</h4>
      <img src="https://rozlyntr.github.io/images/lingsite.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the home page for Ling's Cars website.">
       <p>Alright... where do I even start with this one? The principle I chose to tie it with is alignment, but 
        as I'm sure you can tell there are a LOT of issues going on here. In regards to alignment, right off the bat
        we can see there is no grid being followed. </p>
        <p>The padding/margins to the left are significantly larger and more
        empty than the right because the designer chose to add extra information ONLY on the right side. There is WAY
        too much going on that it's hard to even tell that it's a car rental website. Far too much contrast and the visual
        hierarchy is all over the place -- not sure where to even look. For me, this is a fantastic example of exactly
        what NOT to do.
